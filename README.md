# React Playground

This is the React handson playground

## To use

There are several simple server implementations included. They all serve static files from `public/` and handle requests to `/api/comments` to fetch or add data. Start a server with one of the following:

#To run this example Node needs to be installed
npm install
node server.js
```




## Environmental  port variable

You can change the port number by setting the `$PORT` environment variable before invoking any of the scripts above, e.g.,
##example
PORT=3001 node server.js
